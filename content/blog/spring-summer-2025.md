I've made it through another semester in my MLIS program. I was horrendously busy, but both of my courses were great! The first was on academic research methods which was quite helpful; despite working in an academic environment for years, the actual mechanics of how research is performed and published has always been foreign to me.[^1]  My other course was very broadly about electronic records management with a good deal of new concepts sprinkled in that I got very excited about (Computational archival science! Digital preservation and bitstreams! [Emulation-as-a-service!!!](https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.124)) 

### Current Stuff

- This week[^2] I began a six-week summer course on digital libraries, so most of my time will be spent absorbing that.
- Reading about [weird old OCLC projects from the 70s and 80s](https://library.oclc.org/digital/collection/p267701coll27/id/17156/rec/19), like this pilot of a [videotex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotex) home-delivery library system.
- Changing how I write and take notes - I told myself I'd get a Supernote Manta after the semester ended, so now comes the part where I need to integrate it into my "process" (which mostly involves a lot of lists) so that it remains in use. Maybe that'll be another post.
- Trying to learn how to write Gentoo ebuilds.
- Going to library/GLAM conferences - next month I'll be at Open Repositories in Chicago.

[^2]: When I began writing this post the semester had just ended and my digital libraries course was two to three weeks out... Oops. I tend to let drafts languish.
[^1]: I now know much more than I ever wanted to about the publishing side of things. Though since I have a university email address, I've always gotten emails asking I have any articles to submit to various extremely reputable and prestigious OA journals... but surely this is just a part of a healthy academic publishing environment.
